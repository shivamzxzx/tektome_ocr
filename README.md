# Mock OCR APIs

This repository contains a set of APIs which mocks the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process on documents, performs vector search, and managing file uploads. The APIs are built using Django-ninja, Celery, Redis, and integrated with OpenAI for text embeddings, and Pinecone for vector-based searches.
